# THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED
This project has been declared dead. 
This was the culmination of multiple issues, the biggest being a lack of volunteers with the right skillset. That combined with a waning interest in the community and an inability to effectively provide support for indev0.1 led to very little progress being done over the course of many months.

All first party code within this repository is now in the public domain. (This does not apply to any dependencies or F4SE which still fall under their own licensing terms)
